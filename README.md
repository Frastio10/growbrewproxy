# growbrewproxy

.NET requirements: .NET 5.0+ (ATTENTION, THIS IS NECESSARY NOW!)
If you have issues with ENet.Managed, try reinstalling the NuGet packet ENet.Managed please!

- Print all variant list functions sent by server.
- AAP bypass no infos, only password and growid. (SPOOF YOUR MAC TO 02:00:00:00:00:00 (it has ":00" missing so add that before clicking change mac button) (EDIT: used ios platform id, since it got patched it uses android platform id now)
- RGB Skin (somewhat, was too lazy to fix having too dark / light skin)

- Ignore autoban packets by client (if the check was server sided, you can still get banned)
- Ignore tracking packets and crash log requests
- Spoofed RID all the time, and login packet is made so most identifiers/information wont be included.

Enjoy the **ultimate** haXing in Growtopia :) Star this if you liked my project, thanks!

NOTE: Make sure you allow unsafe code when compiling
